I included the Chart.js library to easily apply data viz. Also made the app responsive for mobile devices. When you select a date from the drop down, it will highlight the row in the table for you to easily see what ou selected, it also changes the date in the chart title, and auto populate the data within the bar chart. You can find this app hosted at firebase with the url of https://fruit-stand-9af2b.firebaseapp.com/
